## How to Add Entries

When an approach fails after multiple attempts, add an entry:

```markdown
### [DATE] — [Brief title of the failure]
**Context:** What were you trying to do?
**Approach tried:** What did you try?
**Why it failed:** Root cause
**Resolution:** What actually worked (or "unresolved — awaiting human decision")
**Tags:** [library-conflict | type-error | test-failure | architecture | security | performance]
```
