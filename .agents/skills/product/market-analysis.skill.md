# market-analysis Skill

This skill guides the research validation of a product idea against the market reality.

## 1. Competitive Analysis (Comparison Matrix)
Create a matrix of Direct and Indirect competitors.

| Feature | Us | Competitor A | Competitor B |
|---|---|---|---|
| **Price** | $$ | $$$ | $ |
| **Speed** | Real-time | Batch | Real-time |
| **UX** | Mobile-First | Desktop | Legacy |

## 2. SWOT Framework
- **Strengths**: Internal advantages (e.g., "We have proprietary data").
- **Weaknesses**: Internal gaps (e.g., "Small team, no marketing budget").
- **Opportunities**: External trends (e.g., "AI regulation requires our tool").
- **Threats**: External risks (e.g., "Google might build this for free").

## 3. Differentiation Strategy
- **The "Blue Ocean"**: Where can we win where nobody else is fighting?
- **Verticalization**: "CRM for everyone" (Red Ocean) vs "CRM for Dentists" (Blue Ocean).

## 4. Total Addressable Market (TAM)
- **TAM**: Everyone who *could* buy.
- **SAM**: Serviceable Available Market (Geography/Tech constraints).
- **SOM**: Serviceable Obtainable Market (Who we can actually capture).

## 5. Research Sources (Authorized)
- **Tier 1 (Auth)**: 10-K Reports, Official Press Releases, Patent Filings.
- **Tier 2**: Verified G2/Capterra reviews (look for patterns, not anecdotes).
- **Tier 3**: Industry blogs (take with salt).
