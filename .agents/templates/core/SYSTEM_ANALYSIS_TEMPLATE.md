# Strategic System Analysis: [System Name]

## 1. The Iceberg Model

### Events (What happened?)
*   [Event 1]
*   [Event 2]

### Patterns (What trends are occurring?)
*   [Trend 1]
*   [Trend 2]

### Structures (What influences the patterns?)
*   **Physical:** (Architecture, Network)
*   **Process:** (CI/CD, Code Review, Sprints)
*   **Organizational:** (Team incentives, Silos)

### Mental Models (What assumptions drive the structure?)
*   "We must ship features fast to survive."
*   "Testing slows us down."

## 2. Causal Loop Analysis

**Key Variables:**
1.  Variable A
2.  Variable B

**Loops:**

*   **Loop 1 (Reinforcing/Balancing): [Name]**
    *   A increases B
    *   B decreases C
    *   C increases A
    *   *Result:* Oscillation / Explosion

## 3. Leverage Points

| Intervention | Leverage (Low/Med/High) | Expected Impact |
|---|---|---|
| Change Parameter X | Low | Small stabilization |
| Change Feedback Loop Y | Medium | Faster correction |
| Change Goal of System | High | Fundamental shift |

## 4. Archetype
**Identified Trap:** [e.g., Fixes that Fail]
**Way Out:** [Strategy to break the trap]
