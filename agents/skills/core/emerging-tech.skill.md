# Emerging Tech Skill

## Triggers
- 6g
- iot
- matter
- vector
- bedding
- semantic search
- rag
- edge native
- post-quantum

## Purpose
To future-proof applications for the next wave of connectivity and intelligence.

## Capabilities

### 1. 6G & Edge-Native Design
-   **Ultra-Low Latency**: Design systems for <1ms loops (Haptic Internet).
-   **Compute Continuum**: Seamlessly move workloads between Device <-> Edge <-> Cloud.
-   **Agentic IoT**: Devices that negotiate with each other autonomously (M2M economy).

### 2. Matter Protocol (IoT)
-   **Interoperability**: One protocol for Apple/Google/Amazon smart home ecosystems.
-   **Local Control**: Devices work without internet (privacy-first).
-   **Thread/Wi-Fi 6**: Understanding the mesh network topology.

### 3. Vector Computing (AI Memory)
-   **Semantic Search**: Replacing keyword search with "meaning" search (Embeddings).
-   **RAG Pipelines**: Retrieval-Augmented Generation for grounding LLMs.
-   **Databases**: Pinecone, Weaviate, pgvector strategy.

## Instructions
1.  **Latency Matters**: In 6G apps, the speed of light is the bottleneck. Move data closer to the user.
2.  **Privacy by Design**: Matter devices talk locally. Don't send sensitive sensor data to the cloud unless necessary.
3.  **Embed Everything**: Text, Images, Audio. If it's data, it can be a vector.

## Deliverables
-   `vector-strategy.md`: Plan for embedding data.
-   `matter-config.yaml`: Device capability profile.
-   `edge-placement.drawio`: Diagram of compute distribution.
