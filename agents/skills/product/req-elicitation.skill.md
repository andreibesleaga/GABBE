# Requirements Elicitation Skill

## Goal

Produce a complete, high-quality set of requirements for a system or feature by
systematically working from stakeholder goals → use cases → functional requirements →
quality requirements → constraints. Output feeds directly into PRD_TEMPLATE.md and
EARS_REQUIREMENTS.md.

---

## When to Use

- **Scenario 1 (New Product)**: No existing requirements. Starting from user goals, business objectives, or a concept description.
- **Scenario 2 (New Feature)**: Requirements for a specific addition to an existing system (must align with existing constraints and architecture).

---

## Step 1 — Stakeholder Identification

```
For every system, find:

Direct users:    Who operates the system? (end user, admin, operator, API consumer)
Indirect users:  Who is affected by outputs? (manager, auditor, regulator, end customer)
System owners:   Who funds/maintains/is accountable for the system?
External systems: Other systems that interact (upstream, downstream, third-party)
Regulators:      Any compliance authority with requirements over this system?

Fill: templates/product/STAKEHOLDER_REGISTER_TEMPLATE.md

Key question per stakeholder: "What must the system do for you to consider it successful?"
```

---

## Step 2 — Goal Decomposition (WHY before WHAT)

```
Start with business goals, decompose to system goals, then to requirements:

Business goal → System goal → Feature → Requirement

Example:
  Business goal:  "Increase customer retention by 20%"
  System goal:    "Users can track their order status in real-time"
  Feature:        "Order tracking page"
  Requirements:   [WHEN order status changes, system SHALL notify user via email]
                  [WHEN user opens order page, system SHALL display current status]

Techniques:
  Goal-oriented:  i* (i-star) framework — identify softgoals and hardgoals
  Use-case-based: Use cases from actor-goal pairs
  Story-mapping:  User journey → activities → tasks → requirements

Decomposition test: "Could this goal be met by different features?" YES → it's a goal, not a requirement.
```

---

## Step 3 — Scope Boundary (What is OUT)

```
Before writing requirements, explicitly define scope:

In scope: [list features explicitly included]
Out of scope: [list things explicitly excluded — prevents scope creep]

Example out-of-scope items:
  - Mobile native application (web only in v1)
  - Third-party API integrations beyond [specific list]
  - Reporting/analytics features
  - Multi-language/i18n support

Boundary markers reduce ambiguity and prevent implicit requirements.
```

---

## Step 4 — Use Case / User Story Enumeration

```
For each actor-goal pair, write:

Use Case format (functional complexity):
  Name:       [verb + noun — "Place Order"]
  Actor:      [Authenticated Customer]
  Goal:       [Successfully complete a purchase]
  Trigger:    [Customer clicks "Checkout"]
  Main flow:  [numbered steps]
  Extensions: [alternative paths — failures, exceptions]
  Postcondition: [system state after success]

User Story format (agile/lightweight):
  As a [actor], I want to [action] so that [benefit].
  Acceptance Criteria (Given/When/Then):
    GIVEN [precondition]
    WHEN [action]
    THEN [expected outcome]
    AND [additional assertion]
```

---

## Step 5 — EARS Requirements (Formal Specification)

```
Convert use cases into EARS syntax. Cover all 5 EARS patterns:

Ubiquitous (always true — system invariants):
  "The [system] shall [capability/constraint]."
  Use for: security invariants, data invariants, business rules

Event-Driven (trigger → response):
  "WHEN [trigger event] the [system] shall [response]."
  Use for: user actions, external events, time-based triggers

State-Driven (condition that must hold):
  "WHILE [system is in state] the [system] shall [behavior]."
  Use for: operating modes, session states, system health states

Optional Feature (configurable capability):
  "WHERE [feature/configuration is active] the [system] shall [behavior]."
  Use for: multi-tenant variations, licensed features, environment differences

Unwanted Behavior (defensive requirements):
  "IF [unwanted condition occurs] THEN the [system] shall [protective response]."
  Use for: error handling, security violations, resource exhaustion

EARS Quality Test per requirement:
  ✓ Contains exactly one "shall"
  ✓ Subject is the system (not a person or process)
  ✓ Single behavior per requirement
  ✓ Measurable — can write a test that proves pass/fail
  ✓ Implementation-agnostic — no "using X technology"
```

---

## Step 6 — Quality Requirements (Non-Functional)

```
For each quality attribute, use Quality Attribute Scenario (QAS) format:
  Source:    [who/what stimulates]
  Stimulus:  [what happens]
  Environment: [under what conditions]
  Artifact:  [what part of system is stimulated]
  Response:  [what the system does]
  Measure:   [how we know the response is acceptable]

Key quality categories (ISO 25010):
  Performance efficiency:  Response time, throughput, resource utilization
  Reliability:             Availability, fault tolerance, recoverability
  Usability:               Learnability, accessibility, error prevention
  Security:                Confidentiality, integrity, non-repudiation, authentication
  Maintainability:         Modularity, reusability, modifiability, testability
  Portability:             Adaptability, installability, replaceability
  Compatibility:           Coexistence, interoperability

Fill: templates/architecture/QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES_TEMPLATE.md
```

---

## Step 7 — Constraints

```
Document ALL constraints — things the system MUST or MUST NOT do regardless of design:

Technical constraints:
  - Must integrate with [existing system] using [specific protocol]
  - Must operate on [specific platform/OS/runtime]
  - Must fit within [budget/resource limit]

Regulatory constraints:
  - Must comply with [GDPR/HIPAA/PCI-DSS/SOC2]
  - Data must remain in [geographic region]
  - Must meet [accessibility standard]

Business constraints:
  - Must be delivered by [date]
  - Must support [N] concurrent users from day one
  - Cannot replace [existing system] before [date]

Constraints are non-negotiable. Flag any constraint that seems unreasonable for human decision.
```

---

## Step 8 — Ambiguity Resolution

```
For every requirement, test for ambiguity signals:

Red flags:
  □ Subjective adjectives: "fast", "easy", "flexible", "robust", "user-friendly"
  □ Incomplete comparatives: "better than", "improved", "more secure"
  □ Vague frequency: "often", "frequently", "sometimes", "as needed"
  □ Undefined pronouns: "it", "they", "this" without clear referent
  □ Passive voice hiding actor: "data shall be validated" (by whom? when?)
  □ Options without criteria: "the system may also..." (when exactly?)

Replacement patterns:
  "fast" → "p99 response time < 500ms under 100 concurrent users"
  "user-friendly" → "a new user shall complete [task] in < 3 minutes without training"
  "secure" → list specific security controls (authentication, authorization, encryption)
  "highly available" → "99.9% uptime measured monthly, < 4.38 hours downtime/month"

Ask clarifying questions. Do NOT proceed with ambiguous requirements.
```

---

## Step 9 — Traceability Setup

```
Assign unique IDs to all requirements:
  Functional:    FR-NNN
  Non-Functional: NFR-NNN (or QR-NNN for quality requirements)
  Constraint:    CON-NNN

Create initial traceability matrix:
  Stakeholder → Business Goal → Use Case → FR-NNN

This matrix is used in req-review.skill to verify completeness.
```

---

## Output Format

```
Produce:
  1. docs/requirements/PRD.md (from templates/product/PRD_TEMPLATE.md)
  2. docs/requirements/EARS_REQUIREMENTS.md
     Format:
       ## Functional Requirements
       | ID | EARS Statement | Source (Use Case) | Priority |
       |FR-001| WHEN user submits login form... | UC-003 | MUST |

  3. docs/requirements/QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES.md (from templates/architecture/QUALITY_ATTRIBUTES_TEMPLATE.md)
  4. docs/stakeholders/STAKEHOLDER_REGISTER.md (from templates/product/STAKEHOLDER_REGISTER_TEMPLATE.md)

Priority levels (MoSCoW):
  MUST:   System cannot go live without this
  SHOULD: Expected but not blocking launch
  COULD:  Desirable if time/resources allow
  WONT:   Explicitly out of scope for this version
```

---

## Constraints

- Never skip stakeholder identification — hidden stakeholders = missed requirements
- Every FR must be traceable to a use case or user story
- Every QAS must have a measurable Response Measure — no "fast as possible"
- Ambiguous requirements must be resolved before writing EARS — never carry ambiguity forward
- Requirements must be implementation-agnostic — no technology mentions in FR/QR
- All MUST requirements must be testable — if you cannot write a test, the requirement is invalid
